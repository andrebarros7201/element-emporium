# Element Emporium: A React-based Online Shop

Building my first substantial web application with ReactJS. While Element Emporium is a relatively small-scale online shop, the development process provided invaluable insights into React's capabilities and best practices.

### Main technologies used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- ReactJS
- Git (version control)
- Vite (project setup)
- npm (package management)

### Key features

- Product listing
- Detailed product pages with images and descriptions
- Shopping cart functionality with item quantity adjustment

### Main concepts applied

- State management
- Use ReactJS hooks (useEffect, useState, useContext)
- React Router
- Fetching data in ReactJS using API
- Styling react components
- Conditional rendering

### Key Challenges and Learnings

- State management: Effectively managing product data, cart items using React's state and context API.
- API integration: Fetching product data from a mock API to simulate real-world scenarios.
- Component structure: Organizing components for reusability and maintainability.
- Styling: Implementing a consistent and visually appealing design using CSS modules.
- Responsive design: Ensuring the application adapts to different screen sizes.

### Additional Note

- I employed React Router for navigation between different shop sections.
- Conditional rendering was crucial for dynamic content based on user interactions and data availability.
- User experience was a priority, focusing on intuitive interactions and clear information presentation.

By tackling these challenges, I gained a solid foundation in React development and am eager to apply these skills to more complex projects.
